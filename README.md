# Pass4Win
Windows version of Pass (http://www.passwordstore.org/) in the sense that the store (password structure) is and should be exactly the same between the two programs.

If you want Pass4Win in your language, that's now quite possible with the help of Crowdin (http://crowdin.com/). Drop me an e-mail and I'll invite you as translator. Currently Pass4Win is localized in English and Dutch.

I really liked the idea of a password store I could access on my shell, and even Android devices. But my main PC is a Windows machine.
So I needed a Windows implementation.....

Make sure you have GnuPG for windows installed (http://www.gpg4win.org/) and have at least one secret key.
The setup can be downloaded from https://github.com/mbos/Pass4Win/releases

I'm using GpgAPI (https://gpgapi.codeplex.com/) for interfacing with GnuPG. And LibGit2Sharp (https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) for git integration.
