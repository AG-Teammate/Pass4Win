# Pass4Win
Windows version of Pass (http://www.passwordstore.org/)

This is **alpha software**. Currently it can read an existing password store and decrypt it's contents.

I really liked the idea of a password store I could access on my shell, and even Android devices. But my main PC is a Windows machine.
So I needed a Windows implementation.....

Make sure you have GnuPG for windows installed (http://www.gpg4win.org/) and have at least one secret key.
You need to compile it yourself for the moment as I'm not going to provide binaries for an alpha release.
