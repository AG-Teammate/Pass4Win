{"name":"Pass4win","tagline":"Windows version of Pass (http://www.passwordstore.org/)","body":"# Pass4Win\r\nWindows version of Pass (http://www.passwordstore.org/) in the sense that the store (password structure) is and should be exactly the same between the two programs.\r\n\r\nIf you want Pass4Win in your language, that's now quite possible with the help of Crowdin (http://crowdin.com/). Drop me an e-mail and I'll invite you as translator. Currently Pass4Win is localized in English and Dutch.\r\n\r\nI really liked the idea of a password store I could access on my shell, and even Android devices. But my main PC is a Windows machine.\r\nSo I needed a Windows implementation.....\r\n\r\nMake sure you have GnuPG for windows installed (http://www.gpg4win.org/) and have at least one secret key.\r\nThe setup can be downloaded from https://github.com/mbos/Pass4Win/releases\r\n\r\nI'm using GpgAPI (https://gpgapi.codeplex.com/) for interfacing with GnuPG. And LibGit2Sharp (https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) for git integration.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the add issue button, feedback, bugreports, it's all very welcome!\r\nIf you wish to donate feel free, you can do so with bitcoin 184CdvL6i9sDoEpMNST6J71cepjr7nkaHg. If you don't wish to donate feel free  also :-)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/pass4win/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/pass4win)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
